# Testing Strategy

## Testing Pyramid

### 1. Unit Tests (60%)
- **Scope**: Individual functions and classes
- **Tools**: pytest, pytest-cov
- **Coverage Target**: 80%+
- **Location**: `tests/unit/`

### 2. Integration Tests (30%)
- **Scope**: Component interactions
- **Focus**: API endpoints, model integrations
- **Location**: `tests/integration/`

### 3. End-to-End Tests (10%)
- **Scope**: Full user flows
- **Tools**: Playwright
- **Location**: `tests/e2e/`

## Test Categories

### Model Tests
- Model loading and initialization
- Forward pass validation
- Output shape verification

### Concept Detection Tests
- Probe training
- Concept prediction
- Edge case handling

### API Tests
- Endpoint validation
- Error handling
- Authentication

### Frontend Tests
- Component rendering
- User interactions
- State management

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- Run on all pushes and PRs
- Matrix testing across Python versions
- Coverage reporting
- Linting and type checking

### Quality Gates
- Minimum test coverage: 80%
- No critical issues
- All tests must pass

## Performance Testing
- Load testing with Locust
- Response time monitoring
- Memory usage profiling

## Test Data Management
- Factory Boy for test data generation
- Fixtures for common test cases
- Isolation between test cases
