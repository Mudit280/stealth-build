GPT-2 Model Implementation

A concrete implementation of BaseModel providing access to Hugging Face's GPT-2 language model
with concept detection and steering capabilities.

Core Functionality:
1. Initialization
   - Configurable model size (e.g., "gpt2", "gpt2-medium")
   - Device management (CPU/GPU)
   - Generation parameter configuration

2. Model Management
   - Lazy loading of model weights (Why lazy loading?)
   - Resource-efficient operation
   - Model verification

3. Text Generation
   - Prompt-based text completion
   - Configurable generation parameters
   - Integrated concept detection

4. Concept Integration
   - Dynamic concept registration
   - Real-time concept detection
   - Activation analysis

5. Steering Capabilities
   - Output modification based on concepts
   - Strength-based steering
   - Multi-concept interaction

Example Usage:
    >>> model = GPT2Model("gpt2", device="cuda")
    >>> model.load_model()
    >>> output = model.generate("The future of AI is")
    >>> print(output)

Test Strategy:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for full pipeline
- Performance benchmarks
- Edge case validation

Note: This implementation follows the interface defined in BaseModel while
adding GPT-2 specific functionality.
