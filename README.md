# AI Safety Linear Probe Project - 10 Hour Sprint

## Project Overview
Build an explainable, steerable chatbot using small language models with linear probes to detect and manipulate concepts in real-time. This project aims to bridge the gap between AI safety research and commercial applications.

## Quick Start
```bash
# TODO: Installation steps
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

## Project Goals
- **Primary**: Working linear probe that detects concepts in language model activations
- **Secondary**: Simple interface demonstrating concept "clamping" (steering)  
- **Stretch**: Real-time chatbot with explainable concept manipulation

## Architecture
- **Model**: GPT-2 Small (for initial development)
- **Probe Type**: Linear probes on hidden states
- **Interface**: Web app focused on steering demonstration
- **Target Concepts**: Toxicity detection & company values alignment

## Core Features
- Real-time concept detection in text
- Concept steering/clamping interface
- Explainable activations visualization
- Multi-concept support (toxicity, company values)

## First Tasks
