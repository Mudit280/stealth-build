## Learning Process

1. **Before Implementation**
   - Explain concepts
   - Show examples
   - Discuss best practices
   - Set learning goals

2. **During Implementation**
   - Guide through code
   - Explain decisions
   - Show alternatives
   - Connect to learning objectives

3. **After Implementation**
   - Review code
   - Discuss improvements
   - Connect to broader concepts
   - Set next learning goals

## Learning Feedback Loop
1. Implement feature
2. Review code
3. Learn concepts
4. Improve implementation
5. Repeat with next feature

Would you like to start with any specific concept or feature? I can:
1. Begin with a specific learning objective
2. Start implementing a feature with detailed explanations
3. Focus on a particular aspect of the architecture
4. Create a more detailed plan for any section

Please let me know which approach you'd prefer to start with!
